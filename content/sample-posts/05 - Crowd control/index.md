# AVOID CHAOS
## Protect patient and staff

|Guards must be the first to be alerted|
|--------------------------------------|
|1 guard alone cannot face a crowd => Have enough guards|
|Close everything that can be and control the rest|
|Support of the community leaders at the entrance of the hospital may help|
|Structural adaptations may be useful _(such as, e.g. a good fence, an airlock at the entrance)_|

# EMPTY THE HOSPITAL

## Relatives/visitors

||
|-------------------------------------------|
|No relatives/visitors inside in order to properly take care of the patients.|
|Establish a waiting area, preferably outside of the hospital, where relatives can sit and regularly be informed.|
